# muriquee-landing-page
Dynamic landing page partials for AB testing and standalone development

## How to
This repository contains all files included in the core app's landing page. 

All files are accesable via port `8080` on muriquee.com. 

Images can be access via `//muriquee.com:8080/images` for example. You always have to use the full path.

## AB-Testing
For now create branches for different versions of the page. Later we may implement language based versions and refine the system accordingly.

Example:

```
master
|-- version-a
|-- version-b
+-- version-c
```

etc.
